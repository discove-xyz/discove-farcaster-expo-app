## Testing Dark mode

https://docs.expo.dev/guides/color-schemes/#tips

If working with an iOS emulator locally, you can use the Cmd âŒ˜ + Shift + A shortcut to toggle between light and dark mode.

If using an Android Emulator, you can run adb shell "cmd uimode night yes" to enable dark mode, and adb shell "cmd uimode night no" to disable dark mode.
